## Description

This application it´s named Note Taker and can be used to write and save notes about everything you want to remember in the future. The Project was built with help of express.js to simulate a local server where the notes saved goes directly to a data base JSON file.

The way how the app works are the following:

1. When I open the Note Taker then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
2. When I click on the link to the notes page then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
3. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
4. When I click on the Save icon then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column then that note appears in the right-hand column.
6. When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
